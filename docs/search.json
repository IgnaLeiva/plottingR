(Remember that in R there are several ways to achieve the same result).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogical functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nifelse() works best when defining two levels. It takes three arguments: (1) a condition (e.g., AGE == 10), which evaluates to TRUE or FALSE, (2) the value returned if the condition is TRUE, and (3) the value returned if the condition is FALSE. ifelse(AGE == 10, \"Child\", \"Adult\")\ncase_when() is useful when you need to categorize data into more than two levels. Unlike ifelse(), which only handles two outcomes, case_when() allows multiple conditions, each assigned a specific value.\n\ncase_when(\n    AGE &lt; 13 ~ \"Child\",\n    AGE &gt;= 13 & AGE &lt; 18 ~ \"Teen\",\n    AGE &gt;= 18 & AGE &lt; 65 ~ \"Adult\",\n    AGE &gt;= 65 ~ \"Senior\",\n    TRUE ~ \"Unknown\"  # Default case (optional)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n# 1st: re-defined levels\n\nnew_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n              mutate(\n                Age_group                        = case_when(\n                                                between(Age, 18, 20) ~ \"18-20\",\n                                                between(Age, 21, 22) ~ \"21-22\",\n                                                between(Age, 23, 24) ~ \"23-24\",\n                                                TRUE ~ \"Other\"),\n                Choose.your.gender         = ifelse(Choose.your.gender == \"Female\", \"F\", \"M\"),\n                What.is.your.course.       = ifelse(What.is.your.course. == \"BCS\" | What.is.your.course. == \"BIT\", \"Courses A\", \"Courses B\"),\n                Your.current.year.of.Study = factor(Your.current.year.of.Study),\n                What.is.your.CGPA.         = factor(What.is.your.CGPA.),\n                Marital.status             = factor(Marital.status),\n                Do.you.have.Depression.    = factor(Do.you.have.Depression.),\n                Do.you.have.Anxiety.       = factor(Do.you.have.Anxiety.),\n                Do.you.have.Panic.attack.  = factor(Do.you.have.Panic.attack.),\n                Did.you.seek.any.specialist.for.a.treatment. = factor(Did.you.seek.any.specialist.for.a.treatment.)\n                   ) %&gt;%\n              # Now we need to transform the character to factor\n              mutate(Age_group = factor(Age_group, levels = c(\"18-20\", \"21-22\", \"23-24\")),\n                     Choose.your.gender = factor(Choose.your.gender),\n                     What.is.your.course. = factor(What.is.your.course., levels = c(\"Courses A\", \"Courses B\"))\n                    )  %&gt;%\n              rename(\n                gender = Choose.your.gender,\n                course= What.is.your.course.,\n                year_study = Your.current.year.of.Study,\n                CGPA = What.is.your.CGPA.\n                ) %&gt;%\n             select(Age, Age_group, everything())",

    "text": "When working on an RStudio project, you often need to tell RStudio where to find files like images, data, or other documents. This is done using paths. To understand paths, let’s define two important terms: root and working directory.\n\n\n\nThe root is the starting point of your file system, usually represented by a drive letter like C:\\ or D:\\ in Windows.\n\n\nC:\\ (Root)\n│\n├── Users\\\n│   ├── yourName\\\n│   │   └── My_RStudio_Project\\\n│   │       ├── index.qmd\n│   │       └── data\\\n│   │           └── dataset.csv\n\nHere, the root is C:\\, and all files and folders are branches that stem from it.\n\n\n\n\nThe working directory is the folder you are currently working in. Think of it as your current location in the file tree.\nFor example:\n\nIf your working directory is C:\\Users\\yourName\\My_RStudio_Project\\, the files like index.qmd and the data\\ folder are directly accessible.\nYou don’t need to start from the root (C:\\) every time. Instead, you can use relative paths to refer to files.\n\n\n\nWorking Directory (WD): C:\\Users\\yourName\\My_RStudio_Project\\\n│\n├── index.qmd\n├── data\\\n│   └── dataset.csv\n└── images\\\n    └── plot.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn absolute path starts from the root (e.g., C:\\) and gives the full location of a file.\nExample:\n\nTo access dataset.csv: C:\\Users\\yourName\\My_RStudio_Project\\data\\dataset.csv\nTo access plot.png: C:\\Users\\yourName\\My_RStudio_Project\\images\\plot.png\n\n\n\n\nA relative path starts from the working directory and is shorter because it doesn’t include the root.\nExample:\n\nIf your working directory is C:\\Users\\yourName\\My_RStudio_Project\\, to access dataset.csv in the data folder: ./data/dataset.csv\nTo access plot.png in the images folder: ./images/plot.png\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how to use these paths in an R script file:\n\nUsing Absolute Paths (Not Recommended): read.csv(\"C:/Users/yourName/My_RStudio_Project/data/dataset.csv\")\nUsing Relative Paths (Recommended): read.csv(\"./data/dataset.csv\")\n\nThe second option (relative paths) is better because it makes your project portable, meaning others can use it without needing to change the file paths.",
