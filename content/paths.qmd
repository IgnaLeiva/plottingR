# Paths: The Basics

When working on an **RStudio project**, you often need to tell RStudio where to find files like images, data, or other documents. This is done using **paths**. To understand paths, let’s define two important terms: **root** and **working directory**.

---

## What Is the Root?

The **root** is the starting point of your file system, usually represented by a drive letter like `C:\` or `D:\` in Windows.

### Example of a File Structure

```plaintext
C:\ (Root)
│
├── Users\
│   ├── yourName\
│   │   └── My_RStudio_Project\
│   │       ├── index.qmd
│   │       └── data\
│   │           └── dataset.csv

```

Here, the root is  `C:\`, and all files and folders are branches that stem from it.

## What Is the Working Directory (WD)?

The **working directory** is the folder you are currently working in. Think of it as your current location in the file tree.

**For example:**

- If your working directory is `C:\Users\yourName\My_RStudio_Project\`, the files like `index.qmd` and the `data\` folder are directly accessible.

- You don’t need to start from the root `(C:\)` every time. Instead, you can use _relative paths_ to refer to files.

### Visual Example of WD

```plaintext
Working Directory (WD): C:\Users\yourName\My_RStudio_Project\
│
├── index.qmd
├── data\
│   └── dataset.csv
└── images\
    └── plot.png
```

## Paths: Absolute vs. Relative

### Absolute Path

An absolute path starts from the root (e.g., `C:\`) and gives the full location of a file.

**Example:**

- To access dataset.csv: `C:\Users\yourName\My_RStudio_Project\data\dataset.csv`

- To access plot.png: `C:\Users\yourName\My_RStudio_Project\images\plot.png`



### Relative Path

A relative path starts from the working directory and is shorter because it doesn’t include the root.

**Example:**

- If your working directory is `C:\Users\yourName\My_RStudio_Project\`, to access `dataset.csv` in the data folder: `./data/dataset.csv`


- To access plot.png in the images folder: `./images/plot.png`

## Example in R project

Here’s how to use these paths in an R script file:

-  Using Absolute Paths (Not Recommended): `read.csv("C:/Users/yourName/My_RStudio_Project/data/dataset.csv")`

- Using Relative Paths (Recommended): `read.csv("./data/dataset.csv")`

The second option (relative paths) is better because it makes your project portable, meaning others can use it without needing to change the file paths.
