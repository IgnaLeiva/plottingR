title: The Pipe Operator
---

The pipe operator `%>%` is a powerful tool in R that allows for clean, readable, and efficient code. 
Originally introduced in the `{magrittr}` package and widely used in `{dplyr}`, it helps streamline operations by passing the output of one function directly into the next.

Why Use the Pipe?

✅ Improves readability – No more nested functions!


✅ Reduces intermediate variables – Keeps code concise.


✅ Enhances workflow – Makes step-by-step transformations intuitive.

**Note**:

There are two types of pipe. Most of the time you can use them interchangeably,, the `{base}` pipe
`|>` and the `{magrittr}` `%>%`, [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/04/base-vs-magrittr-pipe/) their differences
